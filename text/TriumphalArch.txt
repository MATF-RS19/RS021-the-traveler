The Arc de Triomphe Paris, the most monumental of all triumphal arches, was built between 1806 and 1836. Even though there were 
many modifications from the original plans, reflecting political changes and power struggles, the Arch still retains the 
essence of the original concept which was a powerful, unified ensemble. 

The Arc de Triomphe stands at the centre of the Place Charles de Gaulle, also known as the "Place de l'Étoile". It’s located 
at the western end of the Champs-Élysées. The arches whole decorative style is entirely of the tradition of sculpture from 
the first half of the nineteenth century.

The triumphal arch is in honor of those who fought for France, in particular, those who fought during the Napoleonic Wars. 
Engraved on the inside and at the top of the arch are all of the names of the generals and wars fought. There are inscriptions 
in the ground underneath the vault of the arch which include the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I where 
the Memorial Flame burns and have made the Arc de Triomphe Paris a revered patriotic site. 

The monument is considered the linchpin of the historic axis (L'Axe historique) — a sequence of monuments and grand 
thoroughfares on a route which stretches from the courtyard of the Louvre Palace to the outskirts of Paris. 

Groups, friezes, figures and bas-reliefs are the signature works of James Pradier, Antoine Etex and Jean-Pierre Cortot. 
But there is no question that the most celebrated sculpture is the work of Francois Rude: La Marseillaise.

The Arc de Triomphe stands 49.5 m (162 ft) tall, 45 m (150 ft) wide and 22 m (72 ft) deep. The vault is 29.19 m (95.8 ft) high 
and 14.62 m (48.0 ft) wide. The smaller vault is 18.68 m (61.3 ft) high and 8.44 m (27.7 ft) wide.
